Databricks File System - DBFS

https://docs.databricks.com/user-guide/dbfs-databricks-file-system.html

Databricks File System (DBFS) is a distributed file system installed on Databricks clusters. Files in DBFS persist to S3, so you wonâ€™t lose data even after you terminate a cluster.

You can access files in DBFS using the Databricks CLI, DBFS API, Databricks Utilities, Spark APIs, and local file APIs.

On your local computer you access DBFS using the Databricks CLI or DBFS API. In a Spark cluster you access DBFS using Databricks Utilities, Spark APIs, or local file APIs.

DBFS allows you to mount S3 buckets so that you can seamlessly access data without requiring credentials.

In the past, DBFS used an S3 bucket created in the Databricks account to store data that is not stored on a DBFS mount point. At your request, Databricks can switch this over to an S3 bucket in your own account.
